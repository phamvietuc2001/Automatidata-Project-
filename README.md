# **Automatidata Project**

Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

### **In this project, is divided into six portfolio projects represented in each course:** 
* The 1st is the `project proposal`, which is the outlined milestones that need to be completed in each phase from the beginning to end throughout the whole project (course 1).
* The 2nd is to begin exploring the dataset by using `Python` (course 2).
* The 3rd is to dig deeper into the dataset by performing the `Exploratory Data Analysis` process and `visualizations` (course 3).
* The 4th is to perform `A/B testing` (using a two-sample t-test) to analyze whether there is a relationship between `payment type` and `fare amount`. Particularly, whether the customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash (course 4).
* The 5th is to build a `multiple linear regression model` through the request of New York City TLC to predict the taxi `fare rides` in advance (course 5).
* The final phase is to develop the `machine-learning model(s)` to predict whether riders will be `generous tippers` (by tipping 20% or more) (course 6).

### Each portfolio project included the **PACE strategy document** and **executive summary**. PACE document stands for Plan-Analyze-Construct-Execute, which is to outline the needed steps to take to complete the project. The executive summary is a one-page format report, that summarizes the key results & information of the project to the cross-functional team members and stakeholders and recommends the next steps to take.
